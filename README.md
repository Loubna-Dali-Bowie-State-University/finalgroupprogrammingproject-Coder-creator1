# FinalProject

**Project Overview and Guidelines**

- **Project Scope**: For the selected project, each group will apply concepts from COSC 112 and COSC 113. Only include topics covered in the course; avoid using material not discussed in class.

- **Group Formation**:
  - Maximum of four (4) members per group.
  - Each group must designate a team lead, responsible for communication with the instructor and managing group tasks.
  - All group members must contribute to the coding portion of the project, not just the proposal/report/presentation.

- **Team Lead Responsibilities**:
  - Introduce themselves to the instructor.
  - Facilitate task delegation within the group.
  - Act as the primary contact for all instructor communications.

- **Proposal Submission**: Submit your project proposal document via the Blackboard submission box by ** December 6, 2024, at 11:59 pm**.

- **Project Requirements**:
  - Choose a project that aligns with the course themes, such as database applications, game development, or applied problem-solving.
  - Projects should have comparable scope and complexity.
  - While Java Swing/JavaFX tools are recommended, alternative tools may be used with justification.

- **Selecting a Project**:
  - Projects should directly relate to the course material.
  - Consider creating an applied project that utilizes learned tools to model and solve a meaningful problem.
  - Applied projects should include user-friendly features like command-line interfaces, GUIs, input parsing, and customization options.

- **Final Project Proposal Document**:
  - The proposal should provide a clear overview of the project the team will develop.
  - Include the following elements:
    - **Team and Application Description**: Brief introduction to the team and the application.
    - **Program Objectives**: Outline the goals of the program.
    - **Background**: Summarize the projectâ€™s background and restate its purpose.
    - **Algorithm Development**: Describe the main algorithms to be implemented.
    - **Wireframe** (optional): Basic visual representation of the application layout.
    - **Scope of Work**: Outline the tasks and milestones.
    - **Features**: List key features of the application.
    - **Success Measures**: Define how project success will be measured.
    - **Resources**: Identify any resources or tools needed.
    - **Concepts**: Specify course concepts applied in the project.
    - **Third-Party Libraries**: List any external libraries planned for use.
    - **Non-Standard GUI Design**: If applicable, outline any custom GUI elements.
    - **Image Repository**: Mention any visual assets and their sources.

Please adhere to these guidelines to ensure a well-structured and successful project.
